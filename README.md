# E-Commerce Website

UPDATE: 10/ 1/ 21 - I am currently working to re-establish my Firebase/ Firestore data, as it has expired.

This was the fifth and final individual project we were given at _nology.

We were to build an ecommerce project using React and Firestore.

Requirements included having a home page, an individual product page, having a grid of products, a carousel, and to select variants.

I am intending on building more projects of this nature to continue to develop my full-stack capacities.

The main learnings I have had during this project are --
+ Developing confidence using React (and Bootstrap)
+ How to use Firebase/ Firestore 
+ How to render items from a database
+ More JS/JSX competency

Items to be refined in my E-Com --
+ Altering overall styling
+ Adding a dropdown on individual product pages to select specific colours
+ Building in a "cart" system as a challenge
